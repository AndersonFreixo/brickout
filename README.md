# brickout
A breakout clone

This project was based on a <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript">Mozilla's tutorial on how to make a 2d breakout clone using pure JS</a>, but the code is being completely rewritten.

Some of the changes made up to now are:
<ul>
  <li>Encapsulation of entities of the game.</li>
  <li>Better collision detection system.</li>
  <li>Changes in the mechanics of the interaction between ball and paddle.</li>
  <li>Changes in the style and number of bricks per column and row.</li>
  <li>A level system (in progress)</li>
  <li>Extra canvas to show game info</li>
  <li>Objects are now loaded from image files instead of being drawn in each loop.</li> 
  <li>Some sound effects.</li>
</ul>

Updates:
<ul>
  <li>07/09/2020 - Implementation of an initial screen with a button to start the game.</li>
  <li>07/08/2020 - Implementation of an audio system with multiple channels.</li>
</ul>
