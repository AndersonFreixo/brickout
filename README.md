A breakout clone

This game is based on a <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript">Mozilla's tutorial on how to make a 2d breakout clone using pure JS</a>. The code is being completely refactored.

Some of the changes made up to now are:
<ul>
  <li>Encapsulation of entities of the game (in progress).</li>
  <li>Better collision detection system.</li>
  <li>Changes in the mechanics of the interaction between ball and paddle.</li>
  <li>Changes in the style and number of bricks.</li>
</ul>
